## Classical-Mechanics-John-R-Taylor

This repository will be used for me to store all my numerical method codes to solve all (at least I will try) the problems presented in the book.

The book that I have is "Mecânica Clássica John R. Taylor, 2013" It's the Brazilian edition translated by Waldir Leite Roque (PhD in Applied Mathematics by University of Cape Town, Postdoc in Computer Science by Universität Karlsruhe and Professor at Mathematics Institute of Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul).

If you are a Physics Student, Engineering Student or just a crazy guy like me that is doing it for fun and want to contribute to this repository, feel free to do so!
